On startup images are read from `face_recognition_path` and a model is trained to recognize these faces.<br/>
The folder structure of the faces folder is very strict. Here is an example of the default one:

```
/config
|── face_recognition
|   └── faces
|       ├── person1
|       |   ├── image_of_person1_1.jpg
|       |   ├── image_of_person1_2.png
|       |   └── image_of_person1_3.jpg
|       └── person2
|       |   ├── image_of_person2_1.jpeg
|       |   └── image_of_person2_2.jpg
```

:::warning

You need to follow this folder structure, otherwise training will not be possible.
