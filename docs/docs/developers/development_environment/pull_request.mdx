title: Pull Request
---

When you are done with your changes it is time to submit a pull request.

Before you create a pull request, please make sure that you have done the following:

- Tests are written for the changed code
- Commits have meaningful messages
- If you have made changes to the backend:
  - `pre-commit run --all-files` passes without any errors
  - `pytest tests/` passes without any errors
- If you have made changes to the frontend:
  - `npm run lint` passes without any errors
  - `npm run test` passes without any errors

### CI pipeline

When submitting a Pull Request, it is automatically checked by the CI pipeline.
If you followed the steps outlined above, you can be pretty confident that your changes won't fail the CI pipeline.

I will review and incorporate your changes as fast as possible when the checks pass. If you do not understand how to fix any alerts by the pipeline, I will assist the best I can!
